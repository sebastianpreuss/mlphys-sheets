## Machine Learning and Physics, Sheet 7 

### Setup
For this sheet we set up a new conda environment, that includes pytorch.

Clone this repo and navigate into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hci-unihd/mlph_sheet07.git
cd mlph_sheet07
```
Install and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
conda activate mlph2
```
Then you can start jupyter (run `jupyter notebook`) and open sheet07.ipynb, 
which you should use as the basis for the solution of the practical excercises.


### Hand in
 Hand in both your jupyter notebook, and an exported pdf (File -> Download as -> pdf). 
 If you encounter problems exporting the pdf like this, please print your notebook to pdf and hand this in.
