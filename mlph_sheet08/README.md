## Machine Learning and Physics, Sheet 8 

### Setup
Use the same conda environment as for Sheet 1.

Clone this repo and navigate into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hci-unihd/mlph_sheet08.git
cd mlph_sheet08
```
Activate the conda environment from sheet 1:
```bash
conda activate mlph
```
Then you can start jupyter (run `jupyter notebook`) and open sheet08.ipynb, 
which you should use as the basis for the solution of the practical excercises.


### Hand in
 Hand in both your jupyter notebook, and an exported pdf (File -> Download as -> pdf). 
 If you encounter problems exporting the pdf like this, please print your notebook to pdf and hand this in.
